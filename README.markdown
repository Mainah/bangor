Bangor GIS Data Disclaimer:

The City of Bangorâ€™s basic planimetric and topographic data was provided from photogrammetric mapping by James Sewall Company in spring of 2010.  Additional layers were developed by City staff by digitizing existing maps, plans & aerial photography, and by locating features in the field.  Not all data layers are actively updated.  All data is projected in NAD1983 Maine State Plane - East Zone, in US Feet.

This data is intended to be used for general information and planning purposes only.   This data is not a survey and should not be used as such.  The City assumes no liability for any errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the information provided regardless of how caused.   The City further assumes no liability for any decision made or action taken or not taken by the user in reliance upon any information or data furnished hereunder.
